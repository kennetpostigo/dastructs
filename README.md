Dastructs is a neat dependency-free library packed with novelty data structures
and polymorphic functions that operate on them. Dastructs is short for (Da)ta
(Struct)ures. I made this library to gain a deeper understanding of Data Structures
and Algorithms. In the future I plan to also add immutable Data Structures to this
package or create another package for immutable data structures once I finish reading
a few books on the subject.

This library is under construction and will take sometime to finish, but hopefully
if your into data structures you find these to be pretty awesome to work with.
I will try to make the code easy to follow and understand and try to setup a documentation
site that contains examples and explanations.

 + PriorityQueue
