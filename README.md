Dastructs is a neat library packed with novelty data structures and polymorphic functions
that operate on them. Dastructs is short for (Da)ta (Struct)ures. I made this library
to gain a deeper understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. In the future I plan
to also add immutable Data Structures to this package or create another package for immutable
data structures one I finish reading a few books on the subject.

This library is under construction and will take sometime to finish, but hopefully
if your into data structures you find these to be pretty awesome to work with.
I will try to make the code easy to follow and understand and try to setup a documentation
site that contains examples and explanations.
